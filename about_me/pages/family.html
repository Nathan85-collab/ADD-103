      This is me and my family at Dairy Queen celebrating my sisters birthday.
      It was in the middle of the summer and we were quite busy, so she opted
      for icecream. The workers there offered to take a family photo and decided
      to jump in for the last one.

      I was with my Dad, Uncle, and cousins at a resturant in Puerto Rico after
      a very long road trip. The trip was about 8 hours through the mountains
      and we didn't get back into our Airbnb's town till late. Our stop for food
      at a resturant along the ocean led to this photo.
