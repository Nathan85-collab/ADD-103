      This tree is call the Rainbow Eucalyptus, as you can see it is very
      colorful. I bumped up the color contrast on the image to show the colors
      of the tree, my camera did not do it justice. This was apart of a road
      trip in Puerto Rico, we were looking for one the entire trip.

      This was apart of my trip to Iowa for a hot air balloon competion, I was
      apart of crew for one of the pilots racing. I took this photo when shortly
      after everyone got off the ground.

      This was a guard tower in a fortress in Puerto Rico, San juan. The entire
      fortress was really cool to look at because I love history.
