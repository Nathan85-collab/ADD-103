              This is me and my family at Dairy Queen celebrating my sisters
              birthday. It was in the middle of the summer and we were quite
              busy, so she opted for icecream. The workers there offered to take
              a family photo and decided to jump in for the last one.

              I was with my Dad, Uncle, and cousins at a resturant in Puerto
              Rico after a very long road trip. The trip was about 8 hours
              through the mountains and we didn't get back into our Airbnb's
              town till late. Our stop for food at a resturant along the ocean
              led to this photo.
