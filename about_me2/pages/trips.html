              This tree is call the Rainbow Eucalyptus, as you can see it is
              very colorful. I bumped up the color contrast on the image to show
              the colors of the tree, my camera did not do it justice. This was
              apart of a road trip in Puerto Rico, we were looking for one the
              entire trip.

              This was apart of my trip to Iowa for a hot air balloon competion,
              I was apart of crew for one of the pilots racing. I took this
              photo when shortly after everyone got off the ground.

              This was a guard tower in a fortress in Puerto Rico, San juan. The
              entire fortress was really cool to look at because I love history.
