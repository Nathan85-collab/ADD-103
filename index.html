      The feeling of staying inside and being next to a warm fire is unmatched
      by any other time of the year. If it weren't for the Christmas holiday,
      winter would suck the entire season. Look and january for example, after
      new years, the entire month is just a frozen wasteland.

      Christmas decor makes winter pop with color and happiness. The creaitvity
      used to make houses and towns look christmas themed makes going outside
      worth it, despite the 10 degree weather.

      Snow on the ground is so oddly satisfying as it blankets the ground and
      trees. It is very blinding when the sun comes out, but still very nice to
      look at.
