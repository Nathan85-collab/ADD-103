  <h1>Farmin' Marvin's Produce</h1>
  <body>
    <h3>
      Here’s a taste of what Marvin grows and sells with his signature charm.
      Every item is farmed by hand and chosen at peak freshness — nothing
      store-bought here!
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Tomatoes – Juicy, sun-kissed, and just the right balance of sweet and
        acidic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Onions – Bold and flavorful, perfect for cooking or slicing raw for that
        extra kick.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beets – Earthy and vibrant, they roast up like candy (well, veggie
        candy).
      </li>
      <li>
        Delphinium – Tall, majestic flowers with cool colors that steal the show
        in any bouquet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Zinnias – Bold, bright, and cheerful blooms that last long in a vase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lithiansis – Delicate and whimsical, adding a soft touch to floral
        arrangements.
      </li>
      <li>
        Watermelon – Heavy, sweet, and juicy enough to cause a happy mess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Peaches – Fuzzy, fragrant, and bursting with late-summer sunshine in
        every bite.
      </li>
      <li>Strawberries – Red gems that taste like the first day of summer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Everything Marvin sells is grown with care, harvested with love, and sure
      to bring a little green goodness into your life.
