    <h1>Farmin' Marvin's History</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      Long before Marvin was known as the wizard of the wheelbarrow, he was just
      a curious kid growing up on his family’s small patch of land in Willow
      Hollow. The farm has been in the family for three generations, originally
      founded by Marvin’s grandfather, Clive, who traded city life for open
      skies and sweet soil. Clive started with chickens and a dream, and
      Marvin’s taken that legacy to a whole new level.

      Marvin’s parents, Darla and Jeb, raised him with old-school grit and
      garden-grown wisdom. His mom taught him how to spot a sick plant by the
      way its leaves droop, and his dad taught him how to repair a tractor with
      little more than wire and willpower. But Marvin wasn’t alone in his
      journey.

      He’s got two younger sisters, Elsie and June, who help run the booth at
      the weekend farmer’s market. June handles the flowers — arranging them
      like art — while Elsie crunches numbers and handles online orders for
      “Marvin’s Marvel Boxes.”

      They’re not just a family, they’re a full-blown farming operation powered
      by love, laughter, and a bit of stubbornness. Marvin may be the face, but
      behind every perfect peach or petal is a whole team of peeps who make the
      magic happen.
