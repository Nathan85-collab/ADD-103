  <h1>Farmin' Marvin's</h1>

    <h3>
      Welcome to Marvin’s Farmin’ Marvels — where dirt meets dedication! Marvin
      isn’t your average farmer. He’s a master of growing vibrant flowers, crisp
      vegetables, and sweet fruits with a personal flair that’s as charming as
      his overalls. Each crop Marvin cultivates is a reflection of his
      hard-earned skill and boundless curiosity for the wonders of nature.
    </h3>

    <h2>Flowers</h2>
    <p>
      Flowers are Marvin’s pride and joy. From soft-petaled delphiniums to
      vibrant zinnias and delicate lithiansis, Marvin has mastered the floral
      arts. His flowers aren’t just pretty — they’re grown with intention, often
      used in bouquets that brighten homes across the county.
    </p>

    <h2>Vegetables</h2>
    <p>
      Vegetables are where Marvin’s hands get really dirty — in the best way.
      His tomatoes are plump and juicy, onions pungent and strong, and beets
      earthy with that perfect crunch. He rotates his crops and uses compost tea
      to give his veggies a flavor that supermarket produce just can’t match.
    </p>

    <h2>Fruits</h2>
    <p>
      Fruits are where Marvin’s heart shows the most. Strawberries, peaches, and
      watermelon — each one grown with patience and picked at peak sweetness.
      Marvin always says, “If your fruit don’t drip down your chin, it ain’t
      ready.”
